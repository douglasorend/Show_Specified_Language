[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows a user to make a [b]SINGLE[/b] post in multiple language and show ONLY the appropriate language to the visiting user.

For example, if a user posted this:
[quote]
[language=EN]Hi, this is a test[/language]
[language=EE]Tere, see on test[/language]
[language=ES]Hola, esta es una prueba[/language]
[/quote]
If the user had the Estonian language set, he/she would see this:
[quote]
Tere, see on test
[/quote]
Either the 2-character language code (ex: [b]en[/b]) or the 5-character code (ex: [b]en-US[/b]) may be used to specify the language to display.  Note that both [b]en-US[/b] and [b]en-GB[/b] will be matched to [b]en[/b], likewise for other languages.

If the user's language is not found, the code will either display the preferred default language (if specified) [b]OR[/b] the first language code encountered.
